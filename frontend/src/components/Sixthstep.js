      The answer to why you do what you do should be inbuilt into the impact you want to<br/>
      create. Personally, I inspire individuals and organisations to live meaningful lives.<br/>
      inspire my beneficiaries through training and advisory, and as a result, they live<br/>
      meaningful lives. The beneficiaries transform from pursuing anything they can to pursuing<br/>
      what impacts society and fulfils them.</p>
