     <p>Name your beneficiaries. Find your community. You may serve the whole world,<br/>
      but like Apple, which serves a 'think different' or creative community, you must<br/>
       have your own core group. Just because you can write doesn't mean you can write for<br/>
       all age groups. There is a group you can serve better than your peers, so you choose<br/>
       that group, although it is the group that chooses you. Whichever way you look at it,<br/>
       you and the group must understand each other well. Another example is if you sell<br/>
       homes, many people need to own a home, but not all need a high-end home; some need a<br/>
       low-cost home. If you are in this space, you must pick a group you are passionate about<br/>
       serving.</p>
