     <p>These are the loves of your life. You must see yourself as lucky or blessed<br/>
      to work on those pursuits. It is the kind of work you enjoy. I have concluded that<br/>
      sustainable good success is built on the path of less resistance internally.<br/>
      However, externally, this is not guaranteed; in most cases, it is the opposite.<br/>
      At this stage, include all things you love doing. You may include watching cartoons<br/>
      the whole day at this level if it is one of the things you love to do because it could<br/>
      indicate the underlying potential; however, by the time you answer all 7Qs, you will<br/>
      have narrowed down to things you love to do which help others and they are will to pay<br/>
      for them.You should not only dwell at the moment or present but also search in the past,<br/>
       things you love but were discouraged from doing or lacked opportunities to do.<br/>
        Include activities that get you into the flow.
