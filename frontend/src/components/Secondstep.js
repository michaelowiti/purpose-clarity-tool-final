        The challenge here is that you may have unutilised potential;
        <br />
        hence, you must search deeper than what you are currently good at.
        <br />
        You may not even have the right words to explain what you are good at.

        For example, a person who is faster on their hands than their legs may

          good at?
        </li>
        <li style={{ border: "none", listStyle: "none" }}>
          What do you feel uniquely qualified to teach or offer others?
        </li>
